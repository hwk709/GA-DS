Random Forest: Useful if interpretability is necessary.

6. L5 Level: Aggregation by Year, L1 through L5 Identifier

7. L6 Level: Aggregation by Year, L1 through L6 Identifier (Most Granular)

Descriptive Statistics: Entropy, variance, and percentiles for each L6 group.

Advanced Clustering: Group similar L6 units based on behavior using hierarchical clustering or DBSCAN.
Trend Analysis: Compare patterns in granular data using dynamic time warping (DTW) or cross-correlation techniques.
Modeling:
XGBoost/CatBoost: Effective for high-dimensional, sparse data.
Random Forest: Can be simpler and interpretable if other models overfit.
Features Utilized: L0_lag_requirement, L1_lag_requirement, ..., L6_lag_requirement, entropy, variance, and percentiles.
Summary
This approach uses appropriate models and methods like ARIMA, SARIMA, XGBoost, and Random Forest, adapting to the increasing complexity and granularity from L0 to L6. It avoids models like LSTM that require more granular temporal data, ensuring that yearly data and hierarchical dimensions are fully leveraged for robust and interpretable analysis.
