To modify this approach and include multiple independent variables along with encoding (both label and one-hot encoding) at different levels of the hierarchy starting at L2, here's an updated breakdown of the process.

General Approach with Encoding:
Label Encoding: Use when categorical variables have an ordinal relationship (e.g., categories with a meaningful order like "small", "medium", "large").
One-Hot Encoding: Use when categorical variables have no intrinsic order (e.g., categories like "Region A", "Region B", "Region C").
Here’s how the modified approach can look with multiple independent variables and encoding starting from L2.

EDA at Each Level:
For each level, the focus is on understanding the variability, correlations, and distribution of the data. Here’s how you can approach L2 with encoding and multiple variables:

Level 2: Aggregated (Intermediate) Level
EDA:
Explore the distribution of your independent variables like funding level, requirement, and other generated variables.
Apply encoding for categorical variables. Use label encoding for ordinal data and one-hot encoding for nominal data.
Plot year-over-year trends and lag analysis.
Check for stationarity and perform differencing or smoothing if needed.
Modeling:
Here’s how you can approach modeling at L2 with multiple independent variables and encoding:

Multiple Regressors: Include all independent variables, both numerical (e.g., funding_level, requirement) and categorical (encoded with label and one-hot).
Random Forest Regressor: You can use Random Forest Regressor to account for potential non-linearities and interactions among the independent variables.
ARIMA/SARIMA: If you observe time series trends and seasonality, consider using ARIMA or SARIMA.
Example: Random Forest at L2 Level with Encoding
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Sample dataset
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'year': [2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023],
    'program_code': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'D', 'D'],
    'funding_level': [1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 900, 950, 1050, 1100],
    'requirement': [2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2300]
})

# ----- Apply Encoding -----
# Label Encoding for 'program_code' (ordinal encoding if there's an inherent order)
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
data['program_code_encoded'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(data['program_code'])

# One-Hot Encoding for 'program_code' (no inherent order, so we use one-hot encoding)
one_hot_encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
encoded_columns = one_hot_encoder.fit_transform(data[['program_code']])
encoded_df = pd.DataFrame(encoded_columns, columns=[f'program_code_{int(i)}' for i in range(encoded_columns.shape[1])])

# Combine original data with one-hot encoded columns
data = pd.concat([data, encoded_df], axis=1)

# Drop the original 'program_code' as we've encoded it
data = data.drop(columns=['program_code'])

# ----- Modeling -----
# Define features (including the encoded variables) and target variable
X_L2 = data.drop(columns=['requirement'])  # Independent variables
y_L2 = data['requirement']  # Target variable

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train_L2, X_test_L2, y_train_L2, y_test_L2 = train_test_split(X_L2, y_L2, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Fit the Random Forest Regressor
rf_L2 = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_L2.fit(X_train_L2, y_train_L2)

# Predictions
y_pred_L2 = rf_L2.predict(X_test_L2)

# Model evaluation
mse_L2 = mean_squared_error(y_test_L2, y_pred_L2)
print(f"L2 MSE: {mse_L2}")
EDA Steps for Intermediate Levels (L3 to L4):
Aggregate your data at each level (e.g., L3).
Explore year-over-year changes, lag analysis, and stationarity.
Apply encoding where needed (e.g., regions, categories).
Perform correlation analysis to understand the relationships between higher and lower levels.
Example: Random Forest at L3 Level
python
Copy code
# Define features for L3 (including higher-level features, e.g., aggregated totals)
X_L3 = data[['year', 'L1_total_requirement', 'L2_total_requirement', 'L3_total_requirement']]

# Include encoded features
X_L3 = pd.concat([X_L3, encoded_df], axis=1)

y_L3 = data['requirement']  # Target variable

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train_L3, X_test_L3, y_train_L3, y_test_L3 = train_test_split(X_L3, y_L3, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Fit Random Forest Regressor
rf_L3 = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_L3.fit(X_train_L3, y_train_L3)

# Predictions
y_pred_L3 = rf_L3.predict(X_test_L3)

# Model evaluation
mse_L3 = mean_squared_error(y_test_L3, y_pred_L3)
print(f"L3 MSE: {mse_L3}")
Levels 5 and 6 (Lower Granularity Levels):
At L5 and L6, the variability tends to be lower, and patterns may heavily depend on higher-level aggregates (e.g., L1-L4).

Modeling at L5/L6:
Hierarchical Linear Models (HLM): To account for the hierarchical structure of the data.
Random Forest/Gradient Boosting: You can aggregate features from higher levels to predict at lower levels.
Time Series Models: If L5/L6 is time-dependent, you can use time series models such as ARIMA or SARIMA.
Example: Random Forest at L6 Level
python
Copy code
# Define features at L6 level
X_L6 = data[['year', 'L1_total_requirement', 'L2_total_requirement', 'L5_total_requirement']]

# Include encoded features from higher levels
X_L6 = pd.concat([X_L6, encoded_df], axis=1)

y_L6 = data['requirement']  # Target variable

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train_L6, X_test_L6, y_train_L6, y_test_L6 = train_test_split(X_L6, y_L6, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Fit Random Forest Regressor at L6 level
rf_L6 = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_L6.fit(X_train_L6, y_train_L6)

# Predictions
y_pred_L6 = rf_L6.predict(X_test_L6)

# Model evaluation
mse_L6 = mean_squared_error(y_test_L6, y_pred_L6)
print(f"L6 MSE: {mse_L6}")
Summary:
At higher levels (L1, L2): Use time series models like Prophet or ARIMA for year-level trends and Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for more complex relationships.
At intermediate levels (L3, L4): Aggregate features from higher levels and apply Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
At lower levels (L5, L6): Use hierarchical models or Random Forest with features aggregated from higher levels, and apply time series models if necessary.
